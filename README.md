<h1>Hydrogen Energy</h1>

<h3>This is a read me file for the H2 generator project</h3>
<p>
Building a <b>Hydrogen generator</b> to produce hydrogen in order to mitigate the daily need of energy for people in a green way.

In this project we will build an automated Hydrogen generator that will extract <b>Hydrogen(H2)</b> and <b>Oxygen(O2)</b> from water(H2O).
</p>
<b>This is made possible by the process called Electrolysis</b>
